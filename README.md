# RecommenderSystem
-> second project for "AI and the Web" uni course, recommends movies from MovieLens dataset to user

                                   
 Project 2: Build a movie recommender system

Build a personalized recommender system with these components:

    User management, including account creation, login, and logout
    A database component for storing and retrieving movie details and ratings
    A rating function where users can rate movies
    A recommender function that recommends movies according to the user's previous ratings


A list of movies and ratings is to be taken from the Movielens dataset. We use a small version:

Small: 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. Last updated 9/2018.

Make the result available on the provided demo server.

Submit the code and the link to the demo deployment.

 

Proposed steps:

Week 1

    setup the base app on your development machine
    play around with the base app and make sure to understand the code
    add database models for the links.csv and tags.csv files
    extend the read_data.py code to populate the database
    extend the views also to show links to movie databases and tags

 

Week 2/3

    create a database model for ratings
    extend the read_data.py code to populate the database with data from ratings.csv as well
        reading 100.000 ratings takes a while; create a much smaller version of the file for testing
        create user objects/db entries for the users found in the ratings file
    decide on a recommender approach (see lecture) and:
        create function(s) that query the database to build the necessary data for comparing (e.g., user ratings vector for a movie or movie ratings vector for a movie)
        create comparison function(s) for sorting the movies according to you recommender approach
        test the functions for plausibility
    create an interface, routes, and view code for letting users rate movies
    create a view for displaying recommendations for a user
